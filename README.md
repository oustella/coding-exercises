## One coding problem a day 
## One line of code at a time
This repo contains solutions to common coding practice questions heavily commented explaining what the codes do. If I used someone else's solution, the source was acknowledged.

Sources of questions include but are not limited to Leetcode (LC), Hackerrank(HC), Crack the Technical Interview (CTTI, 3rd ed.) and CodeSignal (CS).
