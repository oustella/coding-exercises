    "# Longest Subsequence\n",
    "Given an unsorted array, return the length of the longest subsequence of ascending order\n",
    "a subsequence is a subset of numbers from the original array maintaining the same order\n",
    "but the numbers don't have to be next to each other. i.e. skipping elements is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So what's the difference between a subsequence and a substring?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence takes individual elements from the original array and respects their original order. However, skipping is allowed. In contrast, a substring takes a continuous sub-segment from the original array. This question would be a lot more straightforward using a two pointer strategy if it asks for longest substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "dp[i] reflects the longest length for a subsequence tha ends at nums[i].\n",
    "At first, the longest length is 1 counting itself.\n",
    "Then, for nums[i], look at its previous numbers from left to right 0 to i-1 inclusive.\n",
    "Increase dp[i] by 1 if a previous num is smaller plus the longest length up to that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Keeps track of the max length when one position finishes. Because we aer going from left to right, it won't change again. \n"
